# Novena Prayer Reminder
Sends text reminders with intention and prayer of Divine Mercy Novena, a nine day Catholic prayer devotion.

## What are Novenas?
Novenas are powerful devotions in the Catholic faith that consist of nine days of prayer, usually for a specific intention. 

## What does this code do?
This script sends the daily intention as well as the prayer that is supposed to be prayed for each day of the novena. In addition to the intention 
and prayer, you also pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet on each day of the novena (info on praying the Divine Mercy Chaplet: https://www.thedivinemercy.org/message/devotions/pray-the-chaplet). The Divine Mercy Chaplet is
from Jesus' instruction to St. Faustina Kowalska when He appeared to her in the 1930s. 

Novena prayers were used from EWTN: https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/divine-mercy-novena-9119

St. Faustina, pray for us!
